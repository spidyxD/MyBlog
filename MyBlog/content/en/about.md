Hey! I'm Roger 

Coding has change my world.

ItÂ´s so awesome for me can create a lot of usefull programs or software that help to resolve many problems of the real life!

When I was a child I could not imagine that I would can create something like that but now I know that this is only the begin of everythng in
my life.

I hope come to be the best as a developer and someday create me own company.
