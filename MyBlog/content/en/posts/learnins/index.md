[Never stop to learn.](#). Beyond keeping things fresh to sustain your professional creativity and passion, learning keeps you relevant in our ever-changing world. And, it’s arguably the best job security tool you could have, not to mention that achieving higher levels and honing new skills is a great argument for seeking promotions and raises at work.

“Organizations can’t keep transforming if their employees aren’t learning and their skills aren’t aligned with shifting business demands,” explains Toby, stressing the importance of creating an environment in which learning is encouraged and failure is safe as long as employees learn from it.

“All managers should make learning a core goal for their employees. It’s directly related to their team’s and their company’s success,” he says. “Employees should get the time and support to achieve learning–and be recognized for it.”

His best advice for professional development? Take personal responsibility for your learning.

So, now that you know why you should continue to learn, here are Toby's top tips for doing so on the job.

Decide What You Want to Learn
First, consider how and in what way you want to develop yourself.

Start with broad industry knowledge, which can help you pinpoint areas that most spark your curiosity. Read broadly and often. Your reading list should go beyond regular news. Follow both general business news, like the Harvard Business Review, as well as blogs related to your field. You can also join virtual communities related to your field to read and participate in discussions with your peers.

Try to work in at least half an hour of reading and professional networking each day. As specific topics in your field inspire and interest you, explore them further. Once you identify where you want to specialize, try to attend relevant conferences and even take specific courses to further your knowledge.
